<h1>Always Responsive Accessible Web Page Display and Printing For Any Device</h1>

<p>Because there are many devices and browsers on the Internet. Creating webpages to display content on any device, browser or bandwidth is problematic. Another consideration is with a new version of a browser the old webpage may crumble and the code needs to be rewritten. Pages using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and/or Flexbox may be susceptible to failure. This may be due to conflict with browser display. 
</p>
<p>
When creating websites for doctors, I made this code up in 1999/2000. One doctor wanted his website users to be able to print information using any device and browser from anyhere in the world.  In addition, he wanted the printed pages to have double sided margins to be inserted into three-ring binders. 
Because the <em>Always Adjustable Responsive Code</em> is based on basic HTML,  it can be applied to any webpage display. Watch the page content adjust when on a cellphone and then compare to  a wide screen.

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong><br>
Some users with visibility and/or accessibility issues may need to enlarge the text to a preferred size while reading text on the browser. Users can choose any font size (unless constrained by CSS), and the page will adjust.
Remember, while you may use a wall to wall wide screen to design your website, your viewers may use a cell phone. Another consideration is backwards compatibility. Webpages on mobile devices will display a plain border around the web page, making content readable. 
When using the <em>Always Adjustable Pages</em> code, avoid large graphics. They may not display on all devices, and may have problems downloading because of slow bandwidth. Optimal is to use multiple small images. FollowÂ advice with tables and pdfs. Instead of one huge table or PDF, use several tables and pdfs. Do not forget for section508.gov you need to offer a html or text version for your webpage.
