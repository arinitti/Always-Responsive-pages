<h1>Always Responsive Accessible Web Page Display and Printing For Any Device</h1>
<h2>
(HTML5 Blockquote Version)
</h2>

<p>Because there are many devices and browsers on the Internet. Creating webpages to display content on any device, browser or bandwidth is problematic. Another consideration is with a new version of a browser the old webpage may crumble and the code needs to be rewritten. Pages using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and/or Flexbox may be susceptible to failure. This may be due to conflict with browser display. 
</p>
<p>
When creating websites for doctors, I made this code up in 1999/2000. One doctor wanted his website users to be able to print information using any device and browser from anywhere in the world.  In addition, he wanted the printed pages to have double sided margins to be inserted into three-ring binders. 
Because the <em>Always Adjustable Responsive Code</em> is based on basic HTML,  it can be applied to any webpage display. Watch the page content adjust when on a cellphone and then compare to  a wide screen.

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong><br>
Users with visibility and/or accessibility issues may need to enlarge the text to a preferred size while reading on the browser. The option of increasing or decreasing the size of the font relative to the default size, as in <font size="+1(num)"> or <font size="-1(num)"> , where "num" is a number. This allows the fonts to resize according to the page.

Users can choose any font size (unless constrained by CSS or text boxes), and the page will adjust.
  Centered and percentage table options keeps the text tidy, when users enlarge the text within. Designers may want to drop back to Html 4.01.
