<p>Because there are many devices and browsers on the Internet. Creating
 webpages to display content on any device, browser or bandwidth is 
problematic. Another consideration is with a new version of a browser 
the old webpage may crumble and the code needs to be rewritten. Pages 
using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and/or Flexbox may be susceptible to 
failure. This may be due to conflict with browser display. 
</p>
<p>
When creating websites for doctors, I made this code up in 1999/2000. 
One doctor wanted his website users to be able to print information 
using any device and browser from anyhere in the world.  In addition, he
 wanted the printed pages to have double sided margins to be inserted 
into three-ring binders. 
Because the <em>Always Adjustable Responsive Code</em> is based on basic
 HTML,  it can be applied to any webpage display. Watch the page content
 adjust when on a cellphone and then compare to  a wide screen.

- Legacy browsers are not an issue.<br>
- Difficult browsers are not an issue.<br>
- Backwards compatibility is not an issue.<br>
- It can print any webpage straight from the net. 
</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong><br>
Some users with visibility and/or accessibility issues may need to 
enlarge the text to a preferred size while reading text on the browser. 
Users can choose any font size (unless constrained by CSS), and the page
 will adjust.
Remember, while you may use a wall to wall wide screen to design your 
website, your viewers may use a cell phone. Another consideration is 
backwards compatibility. Webpages on mobile devices will display a plain
 border around the web page, making content readable. 
When using the <em>Always Adjustable Pages</em> code, avoid large 
graphics. They may not display on all devices, and may have problems 
downloading because of slow bandwidth. Optimal is to use multiple small 
images. Follow&nbsp;advice with tables and pdfs. Instead of one huge 
table or PDF, use several tables and pdfs. Do not forget for 
section508.gov you need to offer a html or text version for your 
webpage.
