<h1>Always Responsive Pages</h1>
  
<h2>Create Always Responsive Accessible Web Page Display and Printing For Any Device World Wide</h2>
  <p>This code idea will work with any internet connection,and device. 
    Users should be able to view webpages and print without any problem.
   </p>
  <p>
When creating websites for doctors, I made this code up in 1999/2000. One doctor wanted his website users to be able to print information using any device and browser from anywhere in the world.  In addition, he wanted the printed pages to have double sided margins to be inserted into three-ring binders. 
Because the <em>Always Adjustable Responsive Code</em> is based on basic HTML, it can be applied to any webpage display. 
Watch the page content adjust when on a cellphone and then compare to a wide screen.

- Legacy browsers are not an issue.<br>
- Difficult browsers are not an issue.<br>
- Backwards compatibility is not an issue.<br>
- It can print any webpage straight from the net.

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong><br>
Users with visibility and/or accessibility issues may need to enlarge the text to a preferred size while reading text on the browser. Users can choose any font size (unless constrained by CSS or text boxes), and the page will adjust.
The option of increasing or decreasing the size of the font relative to the default size, as in <font size="+1(num)"> or <font size="-1(num)"> , where "num" is a number. This allows the fonts to resize according to the page.
Centered and percentage table options keeps the text tidy, when users enlarge the text within. Designers may want to drop back to Html 4.01.
Remember, while you may use a wall to wall wide screen to design your website, your viewers may use a cell phone. Another consideration is backwards compatibility. Webpages on mobile devices will display a plain border around the web page, making content readable. 
When using the <em>Always Adjustable Pages</em> code, avoid large graphics. They may not display on all devices, and may have problems downloading because of slow bandwidth. Optimal is to use multiple small images. FollowÂ this advice with pdfs. Instead of one huge PDF, use several pdfs. Do not forget for section508.gov you need to offer a html or text version for your webpage pdfs.

 <p>The pages in this project are examples. If creating accessible webpages, my suggestion is to check webpage display using the lynx browser.</p>
